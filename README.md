# 140kRealFakeFaces_Detection

1.1.	Project Title:
Detection of Fake Images Generated by GANs Using Deep Learning

1.2.	Summary of the Project Topic and Background:
The rise of deepfakes, powered by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses a significant threat to the authenticity of digital media. Deepfake images, often indistinguishable from real ones, are used for spreading misinformation, fraud, and harassment. This project focuses on developing a solution to accurately detect these fake images using advanced deep learning techniques. By leveraging multiple state-of-the-art models such as ResNet50, DenseNet201 etc., and techniques, this project aims to create a reliable detection method.

1.3.	Research Question:
How can deep learning techniques be applied to accurately detect deepfake images generated by GANs, particularly those created using StyleGAN, to mitigate the spread of misinformation and fraudulent activities?

1.4.	Project Objectives:
1.4.1.	Develop a deepfake image detection system using a combination of machine learning models.
1.4.2.	Achieve high detection accuracy by optimizing models for distinguishing real images from fake ones.
1.4.3.	Evaluate the performance of different models and techniques on the "140k Real and Fake Faces" dataset.
1.4.4.	Contribute to the research on deepfake detection by exploring the challenges and solutions in detecting GAN-generated images.
